# QTrack

This project seeks to help the Princeton University COS Lab TA program track the attendance of their employees. As a Princeton University internal tool that manages student informaton, the site is registered behind CAS authenitication and cannot be accessed by the public.

## Installation Instructions

To use, download the repository and create the following file:

**api_auth.py**

This will allow you to log in and access that database, assuming you have been granted access.

## Features

QTrack allows you to select which students you want to review by supplying a list at the top of the page. Students can be added to and removed from the page by selecting a button from a dynamically updating list of search results.
